# Status Report#### Name : Susan Daniel MathuramTODO#### Your section leader's name: Daniel BlitshteinTODO#### Project title : Detecting Presence Scaner TODO***Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!#### What have you done for your project so far?1. Connected Raspberry Pi into my network system 2. Debugged the common problem of network host because my wifi network is shared and regulated by my apartment management, there are privacy settings and regulated accessibility controls on who can see the network activity. Since I’m a student resident I was not given access. 3. Switched to a different network and connected raspberry pi to that network where I Had access because it was a home router system. 4. Set up the software Arp-scan to start collecting data of the Ip addresses in my network 5. Started to organize the data to adjust to ISSS so I can display certain data with correct parameters so that it doesn’t just show all the IP addresses in the network, need it to show the ones in my specific radius #### What have you not done for your project yet?1. Set up ISSS system and its parameters 2. Used ISSS ‘s data visualization system according to the alert system I Want to create 3. Code using Java or Python to integrate the alert system into something more outside of a website #### What problems, if any, have you encountered?1. Going outside of my usual network and integrating my data after that transition 2. The scanner to organize data within the specific parameters I give it, always gets stuck on a close approximate number I give it or the logic comes back as wrong, so working backwards to fix the logic
