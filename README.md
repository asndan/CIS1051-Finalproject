# CIS1051-Finalproject

# Dificulties I overcame
I found that most of my time was wasted because I couldn't anywhere on campus without a private entity admin controlling the network since everyone I knew lived in dorms or private apartments around campus. I also relied solely on my raspberry pi to carry me through the project which led me to be dependent on it and cause me even more problems. I also found it hard to implement the ISSS streamer while the platform managers hadn't finished any updates to their API plugin management. 

# Solutions I came up with 
To overcome the network security problem, I didn't go hacking around wifi networks, instead I kept reaching out to several friends' friends till I had a friend who lent me her late nights at her home where she setup her own router to let me experiment my project with. I also abandoned my raspberry pi in the middle of my project because I wanted to stop restricting myself and I learnt to balance both the pi and the linux to use its strengths and benefits equally so that I could make the most out of it, this did make it much longer to get anything done but made it easier to debug the python code while sometimes the data crashed. 

# Things I learnt 
While the python script caused me problems in debugging , I would solve by using the critical thinking skills we learnt in our class to break down and build up the logic. I would just comment all the last parts and just test it out piece by piece. It took forever but I was glad I could gain control of the code and go in manually to be able to represent the data organized while working efficiently without any lazy code. It helped to do this as arp scanner and the visualization program both relied on this script to be executed at the same time. 
I learnt my solutions can also come from motivations, I love working with securtity and cryptography problems so being able to combine my passions and problem solve towards it pushed me to keep showing up each week and celebrating the small wins leading up to the end goal.
